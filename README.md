# Advent of code 2022

The problems are solved in Haskell. Each has a main
function so that they can be compiled. Input is read
via stdin. All solutions start with a shebang so that
they can be executed directly on Unix based systems.

Interpreter executed example:
```
cat input.txt | ./01.hs
```

Compiled and then executed:
```
ghc 01.hs
cat input.txt | ./01
```
